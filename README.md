# SmartHeating

## Introduction
The goal of our smart heating system is to save energy costs by dynamically controlling the heat supply in a house, 
depending on whether or not someone is at home. Using a variety of sensors, it can detect the userâ€™s presence. 
It can also estimate the time when the user will arrive at home based on GPS data, to preheat the house to a comfortable temperature.

## Installation
First, you have to generate the docker-compose.yml. Go to the SmartHeating directory (this repository). 
Then make sure that `generate_docker_compose.sh` is executable:
```bash
sudo chmod u+x generate_docker_compose.sh
```
Afterwards you can generate `docker_compose.yml` by executing the script:
```bash
./generate_docker_compose.sh 
```
Finally you can start the microservices: 
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Some useful stuff
#### Start single microservice
You can start each microservice by typing `docker-compose up <MICROSERVICE NAME>`. By doing so you also start 
its dependencies (e.g. MySQL or RabbitMQ). The following example starts only repository (the database service): 
```bash
docker-compose up repository 
```
#### Swagger-UI
Each microservice provides a Swagger-UI. You can use them for playing and testing. Every Swagger-UI can be accessed 
in the browser with the following URL `http://localhost:9001/<MICROSERVICE NAME>/swagger-ui.html#/`. 
E.g. if you want to access the Swagger-UI of the `testservice`, use the following URL:
```bash
http://localhost:9001/testservice/swagger-ui.html#/
```
